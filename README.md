I wrote my thesis in LateX using the [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com/) editor and converted the project to pdf format.

# Some information about my thesis
The task of my thesis was to analyze concepts about applied cryptography and cryptanalysis. It is suitable for both students and more advanced readers and can be used as a handbook or even a manual for cryptology.

I have also implemented some cryptanalytic attacks using realistic scenarios. In addition to the implementation, I have included a detailed theoritical explanation of each attack.
